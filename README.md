# School_District_Analysis

Overview
Initially, the purpose of the school district analysis is to analyze data for all standardize testing from various schools in the district.  Reading and Math scores were evaluated along with each school’s budget to gain insight into performance trends.  This information will be used by District Leadership to allocate funds and establish priorities within the school district.  However, after the analysis was performed, it was discovered that some form of academic dishonesty occurred at Thomas High School among the 9th grade class.  As a result, ninth graders from Thomas High School were omitted from the analysis.  We will address the impact of removing the 9th grade class from the districts analysis.
